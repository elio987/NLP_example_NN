# NLP_example_NN
Here we use three different NN, NER, sentimen analysis and translator
- The run.py file has the three exercises inside, and each folder has each exercise separated. 
- The model of the exercise 2 is inside que folder called "exercise_2_folder/resources/taggers/ner-english/final-model.pt", but you need to train the model first to create the folder.
- To install and run "run.py" use the next command if your default python version is Python3.x:
```pip install -r requirements.txt && python run.py```
- If not:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt && python3 run.py```
